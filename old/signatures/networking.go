		Value:       "15",
		Description: "Usually, the Linux kernel holds a TCP connection even after it is closed for around two minutes. This means that there may be a port exhaustion as the kernel waits to close the connections. By moving the fin_timeout to 15 seconds we drastically reduce the length of time the kernel is waiting for the socket to get any remaining packets.",

		Value:       "1",
		Description: "TCP saves various connection metrics in the route cache when the connection closes so that connections established in the near future can use these to set initial conditions. Usually, this increases overall performance, but may sometimes cause performance degradation.",
